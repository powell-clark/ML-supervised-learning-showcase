# Supervised Learning Showcase on Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a comparative analysis of various supervised learning algorithms applied to the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. It includes detailed lessons, scripts for each model, and a web-based interface where users can visualize data, compare model results, and run models interactively.

## Repository Structure
- `lessons_and_theory/`: Contains markdown files explaining the theory behind each algorithm.
- `scripts/`: Contains Python scripts for each machine learning model.


## Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/powell-clark/supervised_learning_showcase.git
    cd supervised_learning_showcase
    ```

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Read the lessons and run scripts interface:
    ```bash
    python3 scripts/logistic_regression.py
    ```
